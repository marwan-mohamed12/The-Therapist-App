# The-Therapist-App
We delivered a mobile app for therapists to use in their practice, with a front end built with Flutter and a backend with Ruby on Rails and Python for the machine learning part.
we also created a speech emotion recognition algorithm that detects the emotions of users with an accuracy of 93%.
